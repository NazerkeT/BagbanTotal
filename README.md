This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

The following project was done during "NFactorial Incubator",in intensive summer IT bootcamp.

Using this "Bagban" app you can take photo of common house plants and detect them instantly and get useful advices on how to care them.

At the current time, app detects 6 flower species as Anthurium, Cactus, Calathea, Cambria, Lily, Schlumbergera Purple.

To test this app either use this repository or download android version on PlayMarket by this link:

P.S.: App is still under the development, correspondingly some error on load time and detection precision could occur. So, please, take a clear picture of a flower, make sure that internet speed is fast enough and enjoy.

P.S.S: At the current time, app does not detect for flower, not flower. Updates are upcoming.

P.S.S.S: Although, commits are mainly contributed by @BNake, job was distributed equally, being divided into back end vs front end, object classification counterparts.
